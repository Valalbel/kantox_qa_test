# kantox_qa_test
This is the task for QA testing engineer position at Kantox.
I have performed an exploratory testing in the Part I of this task - the results can be found in the pdf file "Kantox_test_Valentina.pdf". 

Then I checked some of the Params with automated test with the help of Postman for Part II - the results can be found in the JSON file called "Kantox.postman_collection.json". In order to view them the import of this file should be performed using the Postman application.
